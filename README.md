# ALX-T and Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project Submission

Wrangle and Analyze Data project - WeRateDogs Twitter Analysis

I wrangled datasets gathered from 3 different sources and in 3 different file formats to produce high-quality and tidy datasets. Afterwards, I analyzed the data in order to explore the:
    - Top 5 most popular dog names
    - Top 5 breeds in the first predictions by the neural network
    - Relationship between the ratings and favourite count
    - Relationship between the number of images and retweet count
